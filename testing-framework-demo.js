// Node.js supports various testing libraries and frameworks to follow test-driven development process. The
// most popular node.js testing libraries and frameworks are given below:
//
// Node.js assert
// Mocha
// Chai.js
// Should.js
// Nodeunit
// Vows.js
// Jasmine etc.

// TDD
// Test Driven Development(TDD) is a software development technique to develop software using unit tests. In this approach, test cases
// are written before any code. And to make test cases pass, the code is written and then refactor the code to make
// it maintainable.

// Behavior Driven Development (BDD)

// BDD is an extension/revision of TDD. BDD does focus on the business behaviors rather than
// implementation aspect. BDD is an Agile software development technique that encourages collaboration between
// developers, QA and non-technical participants in a software development. In simple language, it is like a story
// writing.

// Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD)
// ATDD is a collaborative practice where whole team (business users, testers, and developers) discuss about
// acceptance criteria early in the development process. ATDD helps to ensure that all team members understand
// precisely what needs to be done and implemented.
//
// ATDD is closely related to TDD. In this workflow usually concrete examples are created from a user perspective.
// Thereafter, acceptance tests are developed and run to see the results of failure with the right code based on these
// examples.

// Jasmine is BDD based testing framework that works for both client (browser) and server-side (nodejs)
// JavaScript. It also includes easy to understand documentation with code snippets.

// Mocha is a JavaScript test runner for both client (browser) and server-side (node.js). With Mocha you can
// use a variety of assertion libraries of your choices. Chai is an assertion library widely used with mocha.

// The most popular Node.js ORM are as:
// Sequelize
// Node-ORM2
// Bookshelf
// Waterline
// JugglingDB
// Mongoose for mongoDB

// JavaScript task runners are tools to make build operation simple and clean. They save time and automate
// build operations. JavaScript task runners also help us to manage web development workflow.

// Grunt and Gulp are the most popular JavaScript task runners for managing web development workflow.

// What are Grunt and Gulp?

// Grunt and Gulp are task based command line build tools for JavaScript. They are built on the top of
// Node.js. They are used for automate build process, automate testing, deployment and release process. They
// support various plugins for front-end and node development.
