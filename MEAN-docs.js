// MEAN stands for MongoDB, Express, AngularJS and Node.js. MEAN is a most popular full-stack JavaScript
// solution for developing fast, robust and scalable web applications. It uses MongoDB to store data in JSON/BSON
// formats which makes it well suited to use with JavaScript. It uses Express as Node.js web application framework.

// It uses AngularJS as front-end SPA development. It uses Node.js as Server Side JavaScript environment.

// There are following reasons to use MEAN stack for web development.

//1) One Language - MEAN stack uses JavaScript as a programming language for both client-side and server-
// side. Language unification improve the developer productivity.
// 2)Programmers write code in object oriented fashion and MEAN stack allows you to play
// with same object on client-side, server-side and also in database-side. So, there is no need to use
// libraries for converting data into objects during client-side and server-side interaction.
// 3)NoSQL database – MEAN stack uses most popular NoSQL database (MongoDB) that is extremely flexible
// as compared to RDBMS. You don’t need to worry about the schema changes and database migrations.
// 4)Cross Platform - All the technologies used by the MEAN stack are cross platform compatible. They can run
// on windows, linux, mac etc.
// 5)Free and Open Source - All the technologies used by the MEAN stack are free and open-source. Hence,
// you need to worry about the cost.
// 6) Community Support - All the technologies used by the MEAN stack have very good community support.
// You will find a lot of samples for Node.js, Express, AngularJS and MongoDB


//MONGODB : MongoDB is open-source, NoSQL database written in C++. It was introduced in 2009 by 10gen, now known
// as MongoDB Inc. It is document-oriented database which stores data in JSON/BSON format. It supports dynamic
// schema i.e. No DDL, No T-SQL.

// Now-a-days, programmers write code in object oriented fashion using languages like C#, Python, Php,
// Java etc. Hence, programmers need a database which can store the data in objects. Since, querying and
// manipulating data objects is easy and it reduces the time of database operations.
// And MongoDB stores data in objects. Hence querying MongoDB is easy as compared to RDBMS.

//Angular

// AngularJS is an open-source JavaScript MVW framework developed by Google. It helps you to create
// single-page application that only require HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on the client side.
//
//
// Angular acts as a compiler which compiles html and generate the output. It extends HTML by adding attr, tags &
// expressions. Also, it provides so many features as given below:
// Events Handling
// Powerful Data Binding
// Built-In Templating Engine
// Routing
// Form Validations
// REST API support using $http, $resource services
// Web Storage - Local Storage, Session Storage
// Cookies
// Animations
// Dependency Injection
// Testing
